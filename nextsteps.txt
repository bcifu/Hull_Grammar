Make sure correct print out/parse tree

Device configuration file, device characteristics
Number channels, number devices (look at paper)
For each function used in expression, definition in yaml file

Declare devices then instantiate specefic numbers
PE with function declaration, like same type

multiple radios for each device

Dev {
    PE {
        base frequency (khz)
        Power characteristics (leakage, dynamic power) (split for memory and compute)
        max channels: ____
        outputrate: _______ (float)
    }
    Radio {
        Same as PE, just not dynamic
        power, output rate
    }
}

Read in config file, take expression and multiply by total devices

Need language specified variable for each device (for all channels across all devices)
Need channel_data[#channels][samples per window] -> expected at top of program file
Each device has that same number of channels

Functions grouped

Number of channels * number of devices

Give programmer access to devices
Some language specification that lets you access devices, default variable that always exists

Give config file, then compile can access stuff

Programmer gets number of channels per device, number of devices

Need channel data for programmer

Assumes same channels per device

Remove samples per window

channel_data[#channels][#devices]

All functions can be called with channel_data as paramter
